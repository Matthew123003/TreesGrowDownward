Your traverseLevelOrder() method looks great! It effectively performs a
level-order traversal of the binary tree, also known as a breadth-first
search. This traversal visits all the nodes in the tree level by level,
starting from the root.

Here's a breakdown of what your method does:

    It checks if the root of the tree is null. If it is, the method
    returns, as there's nothing to traverse.
    It initializes a queue (nodes) to store nodes that need to be
    processed. The root node is added to this queue.
    It enters a while loop that continues until the queue is empty.
    Inside the loop, it removes a node from the queue and prints its value.
    If the removed node has a left child, it adds the left child to the queue.
    If the removed node has a right child, it adds the right child to the queue.

This method effectively ensures that nodes are processed level by level,
from left to right within each level.

Function addRecursive(currentNode, newValue)
    If currentNode is null:
        Create a new node with the value newValue
        Set this new node as the root
        Return

    If newValue < currentNode's value:
        If currentNode's left child is null:
            Create a new node with the value newValue
            Set this new node as the left child of currentNode
        Else:
            Call addRecursive with currentNode's left child and newValue
    Else if newValue > currentNode's value:
        If currentNode's right child is null:
            Create a new node with the value newValue
            Set this new node as the right child of currentNode
        Else:
            Call addRecursive with currentNode's right child and newValue

    Class Declaration:
        public class TreeOneZero: This line declares a class named TreeOneZero.

    Instance Variables:
        Node root: This variable represents the root node of the binary tree.

    Constructor:
        No explicit constructor is provided. The class relies on the default constructor.

    Adding Nodes:
        private Node addRecursive(Node current, Integer value): This method adds a
        node with the specified value to the binary tree recursively.
        public void add(Integer value): This method initiates the addition process by
         calling the addRecursive method with the root node and the value to be added.

    Creating the Binary Tree:
        public TreeOneZero createBinaryTree(): This method creates a binary tree with
         predetermined integer values (6, 4, 8, 3, 5, 7, 9) and returns the tree.

    Searching for a Node:
        private boolean containsNodeRecursive(Node current, Integer value): This method
         recursively searches for a node with the specified value in the binary tree.
        public boolean containsNode(Integer value): This method initiates the search
        process by calling the containsNodeRecursive method with the root node and the
        value to be searched.

    Deleting a Node:
        private Node deleteRecursive(Node current, Integer value): This method
        recursively deletes a node with the specified value from the binary tree.
        public void delete(Integer value): This method initiates the deletion process
         by calling the deleteRecursive method with the root node and the value to be
          deleted.
        private int findSmallestValue(Node n): This method finds the smallest value in
         a subtree, which is used during node deletion.

    Tree Traversals:
        public void traverseInOrder(Node node): This method performs an in-order
        traversal of the binary tree recursively.
        public void traversePreOrder(Node node): This method performs a pre-order
        traversal of the binary tree recursively.
        public void traversePostOrder(Node node): This method performs a post-order
         traversal of the binary tree recursively.
        public void traverseLevelOrder(): This method performs a level-order traversal
         of the binary tree iteratively using a queue.
